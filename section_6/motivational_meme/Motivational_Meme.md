Create a motivational post website. <br>
Style it how ever you like. <br>
Look at the goal image for inspiration. <br>
But it must have the following features: <br>
1. The main h1 text should be using the Regular Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts: <br>

2. The text should be white and background black. <br>
3. Add your own image into the images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border. <br>
4. The text should be center aligned. <br>
5. Create a div to contain the h1, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the image and text are centered on the page. <br>
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%. <br>
  Hint: Set the image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div. <br>
6. Read about the text-transform property on MDN docs to make the h1 uppercase with CSS. <br>
